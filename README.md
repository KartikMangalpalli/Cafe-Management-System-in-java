Cafe Management System in Java

This Java application implements a Cafe Management System using the Swing framework for a graphical user interface. The system allows users to input quantities of different drinks (e.g., Espresso, Cappuccino) and cakes (e.g., Red Velvet, Black Forest), calculates the total cost, and generates a detailed receipt. Users can also reset the input fields.

Key Features:

- User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a user-friendly graphical interface using Swing components.
- Order Calculation: Calculates the total cost based on the quantity of drinks and cakes selected.
- Receipt Generation: Generates a detailed receipt with itemized information.
- Reset Functionality: Allows users to easily reset input fields for a new order.

How to Use:

- Enter the quantity of drinks and cakes desired.
- Click the "Total" button to calculate and display the itemized cost.
- Click the "Receipt" button to generate a detailed receipt.
- Use the "Reset" button to clear all inputs for a new order.
- Note: This project is a basic example and can be expanded upon for more advanced features and integrations.
